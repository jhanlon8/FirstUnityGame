# FirstUnityGame
The first game I made in Unity3D.  It is a very basic temple run type layout. A cube is controlled byy the user using "A" and "D" to move. The cube is constantly moving forward and the door will open when the cube is close.  The user's objective is to hit the blue moving objects in front of it.  Each object that is hit will get destroyed and a new object will appear.
